Debugging Google Apps Script (GAS) directly in a dev container is not possible, since GAS runs in Google’s cloud environment, not locally. However, you can develop and test your scripts using the following workflow:

### 1. Use the `clasp` CLI Tool

Install [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) (Command Line Apps Script Projects) to push/pull code between your dev container and Google Apps Script.

```sh
npm install -g @google/clasp
```

### 2. Authenticate `clasp`

Run the following command in your dev container terminal:

```sh
clasp login --no-localhost
```

This will give you a URL. Open it in your host’s browser:

```sh
"$BROWSER" <paste-the-url-here>
```

Follow the authentication steps and paste the code back into the terminal.

### 3. Pull/Push Code

- **Pull code from GAS:**  
  ```sh
  clasp pull
  ```
- **Push code to GAS:**  
  ```sh
  clasp push
  ```

### 4. Debugging

- Use `Logger.log()` or `console.log()` in your scripts.
- After pushing, open the script in the [Google Apps Script Editor](https://script.google.com/) in your browser:
  ```sh
  "$BROWSER" https://script.google.com/
  ```
- Use the built-in debugger and logs in the Apps Script Editor.

### 5. Testing

- Run functions and view logs in the Apps Script Editor.
- Use [Google Apps Script’s Execution Log](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/logging) for debugging output.

**Note:** All actual execution and debugging must be done in Google’s cloud environment via the Apps Script Editor. The dev container is for code editing and version control.
